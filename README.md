# WhatsappPhoneConnect
Connecting any phone number to your whatsapp
- including a number not stored in your contacts.
- including your own number.

The app is automatically being published using Github Actions :
https://github.com/meirkr/WhatsappPhoneConnect/actions
Which only triggers my dockerfile
https://github.com/meirkr/WhatsappPhoneConnect/blob/master/Dockerfile
This dockerfile builds the app and publishes it to the surge.sh free static-hosting site.

You can check the published runtime:
